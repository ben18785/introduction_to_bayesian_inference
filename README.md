# A short introduction to Bayesian inference
This course provides a short introduction to Bayesian inference. By the end of the course, the participant should:

- Know what probability distributions are and why they are used in modelling.
- Understand the goal of statistical inference.
- Appreciate how Bayesian and frequentist approaches to inference achieve this goal.
- Know the elements required to do Bayesian inference and appreciate how they affect inferences.
- Know why exact Bayesian inference is *hard*.
- See how conjugate priors provide a slight remedy.
