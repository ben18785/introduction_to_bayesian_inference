# A short introduction to Bayesian inference
This course provides a short introduction to Bayesian inference. By the end of the course, the participant should:

- Know what probability distributions are and why they are used in modelling.
- Understand the goal of statistical inference.
- Appreciate how Bayesian and frequentist approaches to inference achieve this goal.
- Know the elements required to do Bayesian inference and appreciate how they affect inferences.
- Know why exact Bayesian inference is *hard*.
- See how conjugate priors provide a slight remedy.

The course consists of a [lecture](./presentations/introduction_to_bayesian_inference.pdf) and problem sets:

- [*Disease prevalence exercise*](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ben18785/introduction_to_bayesian_inference/blob/main/problem_sets/problem_disease_prevalence.nb.html). This example mirrors the material in the lectures and invites participants to estimate the prevalence of a disease. It goes through maximum likelihood estimation and Bayesian inference. The answers (written in R) to this problem set are [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ben18785/introduction_to_bayesian_inference/blob/main/problem_sets/answers/answer_disease_prevalence.nb.html).
